        <h2>projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Sniffer Keyboard - Developed driver that capable of monitoring keyboard input exclusively
                during Firefox sessions and transmitting data to a specified IP.<br/>
                This project honed my skills in UDP servers, threading, and driver development on Linux.</p></li>
            <li><p>IR remote control - Created a system capable of receiving and transmitting IR signals using an Arduino Uno.<br/>
                    This project honed my skills in IR transmitter, receiver sensor, LCD, microcontroller, C++.</p></li>
            <li><p>Hebrew signal processing system - Developed a system where users input Hebrew<br/>
                sentences, which are then sent to a Raspberry Pi acting as a server via TCP protocol.<br/>
                Utilized Raspberry Pi's programming capabilities to execute specific actions based on received<br/>
                commands. The system operates independently without internet, only needing a local WiFi
                connection.<br/>
                This project honed my skills in Python, Pytorch, Pandas, TCP, Raspberry-pi, Linux. Treads.</p></li>
